## 1) I/O Redirection

### Standard Output (stdout)

- By default, stdout goes to the screen.
- Redirect stdout to a file with `>` (creates/overwrites).  
  Example: `ls > file.txt`
- Display text file contents: `cat file.txt`
- Use `>>` to append to an existing file or create a new one.

### Standard Input (stdin)

- By default, stdin is from keyboard.
- Redirect stdin from a file with `<`.
- Combine `<` and `>` on one command line.

---

## 2) Pipelines `|`

- A pipeline sends the output of one command to the next:  
  `command1 | command2 | command3`
- Tip: press `q` to quit paged output screens.

---

## 3) Expansion

- Special characters expand their meaning when passed to shell commands.

---

## 4) Tip â€” Backslash `\`

- Use a trailing backslash to split a long command across multiple lines.

---

## 5) Permissions & Ownership

- Linux is multi-user.
- Files/directories have permissions for **owner / group / others**.

### Changing permissions (`chmod`)

- `chmod` changes file permissions.
- Numeric mapping example:
  - `6 = 110 = rw-` (owner)
  - `0 = 000 = ---` (group)
  - `0 = 000 = ---` (others)

---

## 6) Superuser

- Superuser = full admin rights.
- Use `sudo` before commands requiring privileges.
- Type `exit` to leave superuser mode.

---

## 7) Text Editors

- Linux has both CLI-based and GUI-based text editors.

---

## 8) Shell Script

- You can write and run shell scripts.
- Tip (Windows users): if `nano` fails, use another editor (e.g., Notepad).

---

## 9) Command History

- Show past commands: `history`
- Save history to a file with redirection.

---

## 10) `wget`

- Download files directly into the active directory:  
  `wget [URL]`

---

## 11) `curl`

- Fetch, upload, manage data over the internet:  
  `curl [options] [URL]`

---

## 12) `grep`

- Search for text within files:  
  `grep "search_term" file.txt`

**Options**

- `-i` case-insensitive
- `-v` invert match
- `-n` show line numbers
- `-r` recursive search

**Regex basics**

- `.*` any char, 0+ times
- `\d` digit
- `[abc]` match any of a, b, c
- `^` line start
- `$` line end
